 -- delayed EnableDelayedExpansion gives power to !variables! which is just bizzare

powershell
  Get-Content reads line by line and strips new lines so can split on mutliple new line

lua
 -- arrays can have any index (well its a table)
 multiple values

    UNINSTALL
   - scracth
   - gcc and c++
  ocaml
  opam
  lua
  msys2 and php 

  the worst part is setup!!! e.g php xampp server then relaied cli

cmd - couldnt do two split string loops inside the first??
what does /a do
set /a cardCountArray[%%j + %%i]+=!cardCountArray[%%i]! wont work cause [%%j + %%i]

powershell -

why when two arguents
  String -> String -> Integer 
  Order of executoin where clause?

  oots :: (Float, Float, Float) -> (Float, Float)  
roots (a,b,c) = (x1, x2) where 
   x1 = e + sqrt d / (2 * a) 
   x2 = e - sqrt d / (2 * a) 
   d = b * b - 4 * a * c  
   e = - b / (2 * a)  
main = do 
   putStrLn "The roots of our Polynomial equation are:" 
   print (roots(1,-8,6))

   nice to have array equality


  PHP
  $array = array(
    "foo" => "bar",
    "bar" => "foo",
);

// as of PHP 5.4
$array = [
    "foo" => "bar",
    "bar" => "foo",
];
dollar sign variables
referring methods by string
