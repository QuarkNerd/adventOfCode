## What
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly set of maths based coding puzzles that can be done in almost any language. I do thse for fun. Each day of advent gives 2 parts, meaning a total of 50 stars are to be earned.
Here are my solutions.

#### 2015
I did this year as a practice in around 2022, I got 50 stars, however as I learnt later, my inputs very often lacked artifacts that would make the puzzle harder.

#### 2019
2019 Was the first one I did, I did this in Javascript as it was my main language at the time. I did most questions without any help and totalled 46 stars. The remaining questions were too advanced even after looking at the solution. 

#### 2020 -> 2021
I started to learn rust and applied that. I was able to complete all 50 stars each year with hints only needed for maybe 5 stars each year. One of which was lots of help. I aimed to optimise for speed where I could but didn't always finish

#### 2022
This year I did Java for almost everything. On Day 5 I used JavaScript to make an [animation] (https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zzerjm/2022_day_5_part_one_robot_console_animation_in/). Once again I got 50 stars with little help

#### 2023
The most insane challenge yet, I solved each day in a different language (Including one in SQL). I managed to get to 50 stats but did end up having to look up the solution twice (I allow myself to implement the solution and gain the star if I understand it)
